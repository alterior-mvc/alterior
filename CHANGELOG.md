# ‚è≠ vNext [4.0]

## [BLOCKERS] Features In Progress
* `@/web-server`: You can now specify routes and mounts using the `route()` and `mount()` functions instead of using 
  decorators.

## Changes
- **Breaking**: Alterior 4.0 supports Node.js 18 and newer. If you require older Node.js versions, please continue
  to use Alterior 3.
- `@/runtime`
  * **Breaking**: `Application.bootstrap()` now returns `Promise<Application>` instead of `Application`
  * **Breaking**: The experimental `@Service` annotation and the corresponding `ServiceCompiler` interface have 
    been removed.
  * An error is now thrown if the dependency injection providers specified within your application conflict with each other
  * You can now specify the `prepare` option on your modules in order to perform an operation before the application 
    is bootstrapped. This can be used to connect to databases, for instance.
- `@/web-server`
  * **Breaking**: Renamed WebConduit to ReactiveSocket, and `WebServer#startConduit()` to 
    `WebServer#startReactiveSocket()`
  * **Breaking**: The experimental `WebServiceCompiler` class is no longer available, and `@WebService` no longer 
    accepts a `compiler` option.
- `@/logging`
  * **Breaking**: Removed `LoggingModule.forRoot()`. Use `LoggingModule.configure()` instead.
- `@/mongodb`: New package for ergonomically connecting to MongoDB from within your Alterior applications
- `@/di`
  * **Breaking**: The `Injector#get(token: any, defaultValue?: any): any` overload has been removed. Instead, pass the 
    class you are interested in (`Type<T>`), or the injection token you are interested in (`InjectionToken<T>`).
  * **Breaking**: The `Injector` abstract base class is removed and `ReflectiveInjector` is renamed as `Injector`.
    Similarly, numerous naming changes around the API surface remove the "reflective" designator.
  * **Breaking**: Constructor parameter injection is no longer available. Please use property injection via `inject()`
    instead. Classes constructed by the injector will receive no constructor parameters. Accordingly, the 
    `@Injectable` decorator and all decorators previously used with constructor parameters are removed. You do not need 
    to decorate injectable classes using `@Injectable`.
  * **Breaking**: Factory providers no longer receive arguments, and the `deps` property of factory providers is removed.
    If you need to inject a dependency into a factory function, simply use `inject()` as you normally would.
  * **Breaking**: The `forwardRef()` function is no longer available. Forward references are still supported for 
    providers (both for `TypeProvider` and `ClassProvider`), but you no longer need to mark the forward ref using the old 
    utility function. Instead of `forwardRef(() => MyClass)`, simply use `() => MyClass`. The injector library will 
    detect this and automatically dereference the forward reference.
  * **Breaking**: `inject()` now return `undefined` instead of `null` when the injection is optional and there is no 
    provider for the requested dependency.
  * Adds a `unique` option to class and factory providers which causes such a provider to be resolved every time an 
    injection occurs instead of only once.
  * Introduces a new set of error classes which are now used when throwing injection related errors.
  * You can now use `injectionContext()` to acquire the current injection context. You can use this to acquire the 
    `injector` which is currently resolving a provider or access the `token` currently being resolved. This can be 
    used to make new `inject()`-like functions for more specific purposes.
- `@/annotations`
  * The type transformations used by annotations has been improved to take advantage of modern Typescript features, 
    allowing for better intellisense.

# v3.6.7
- `@/runtime`
  * `RoleRegistration#instance` is now optional. When not specified, the only way to target a role is by its identifier.
 
# v3.6.6
- `@/common`
  * Alterior's standard error classes now extend from `Error`
  * The inaccessible `innerError` property has been removed. Use the ES standard `cause` instead.

# v3.6.5
- `@/runtime`
  * Fixed an issue where using role identifiers within environment/command-line configuration could 
    cause the wrong role to be enabled if multiple roles are defined within a single module.
  * An error is now thrown if a role specified in the effective roles configuration does not exist.
  * `RolesService#configure()` now accepts string identifiers of roles in addition to class references.
  * `RolesService#getForModule()` now throws if there are multiple roles defined for the given module.

# v3.6.3
- `@/platform-nodejs`
  * Upgrades Zone.js to 0.14.3
  * Loads the Node.js specific Zone.js bundle
  * Loads the RxJS zone patch
  * Loads reflect-metadata and source-map-support before initializing `dotenv`.
- `@/web-server`
  * To help avoid accidentally using ES2017 or later (which is not supported by Alterior 
    or any other libraries which use Zone.js), an error will now be thrown if a native async function is used as a route method.

# v3.6.2
- `@/runtime`: Fixes an issue where the short form of the new `--roles-skip` command line option (`-x`) was 
  ignored.

# v3.6.1
- `@/runtime`: Add `enabledByDefault` to `RoleRegistration` and default to all services which are enabled by default.
  Allows for some roles to be disabled unless specifically asked for. Roles which are disabled by default are still 
  included in `all-except` configuration. Use the new `default-except` (or via `ALT_ROLES_DEFAULT_EXCEPT` environment
  variable) to enable all default services except those listed. Additionally there is now an `--roles-skip` option 
  which enables the `default-except` mode.
 
# v3.6.0
- `@/runtime`: Allow specifying additional providers when bootstrapping an application
- `@/platform-nodejs`
    - `dotenv` version 16.3.1
        - **Please note these changes**
            * Comments are now supported
            * Multiline strings are now supported
            * Backtick quotes are now supported
    - `ws` version 8.16.0
    - `source-map-support` version 0.5.21
- `@/logging`: 
    * Added missing `fatal()` convenience function
    * Added static shortcuts to `Logger` (ie `Logger.info()` means `Logger.current.info()`)
# v3.5.8
- `@/web-server`:
  - Fixes a bug where TLS options are not properly initialized in some cases, causing a crash.
  - Fixes a bug where automatically generated self-signed certificates (when requesting HTTP/2 or SPDY without specifying
    a certificate) are not used, causing the server to boot into HTTP only mode instead of HTTPS.

# v3.5.7
- `@/web-server`:
  - Fixes more semantic issues with certificate generator on Forge

# v3.5.6
- Re-release of packages to resolve package resolution issues

# v3.5.5
- `@/web-server`: Fix a semantic issue with the Forge library in certificate generation 

# v3.5.4
- Sources are now included with packages to enable easier sourcemap debugging of the Alterior packages.

# v3.5.3
- `@/di`: Better type safety for TypeProvider (must be concrete type) while still allowing for injection tokens to be 
  abstract. Fixes an issue where `inject()` could not accept an abstract class, even though that is a common pattern
  for swappable injectables.
# v3.5.2
- `@/runtime`: `ExecutionContext.current.application` is now available before `altOnInit` runs

# v3.5.1
- `@/logging`: `Logger.current` does not use the `Logger` instance configured in application injector

# v3.5.0
- `@/di`: `inject()` now supports `skipSelf`, `self`, and `optional` options.
- `@/web-server`
    * Add support for SNI
    * Add support for serving both HTTP and HTTPS via a secondary port
- `@/fastify`
    * Fix missing support for Alterior seamless websockets
    * Fix missing support for Alterior TLS certificate generation
    * Fix missing support for serving TLS/SPDY

# 3.4.2
- `@/platform-nodejs`: Add support for `dotenv-flow` style usage of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. When `NODE_ENV`
  is set, the filename searched is `.env.{NODE_ENV}` to allow you to configure multiple environments in separate `.env`
  files.

# üöÄ3.4.0
- `@/di`: Support for imperative injection via the `inject()` function.

# üöÄ3.3.0
- `@/web-server`: Request logging has been improved, and is now highly customizable. Support has been added for filtering
  sensitive parameters during request logging.

# üöÄ3.2.0
- All packages now depend on RxJS 7.8.0 or later.

# üöÄ3.1.15

# üöÄ3.1.14
- `@/web-server`: Support path-limited middleware

# üöÄ3.1.13
- `@/web-server`: Fix a memory leak when many requests are processed in a single HTTP session

# üöÄ3.1.12
- `@/logging`: It is now possible to change the configured log listeners on the fly
- `@/terminal`: Introducing the `TerminalUI` class which can be used to create real-time terminal UI applications

# üöÄ3.1.11
- `@/terminal`: Accept numbers (in addition to strings) in `style` functions

# üöÄ3.1.8
- `@/terminal`: Fixes some issues in the implementation of `read`

# üöÄ3.1.7
- `@/terminal`: Introduced

# üöÄ3.1.6

# üöÄ3.1.5
- `@/platform-angular`: Supports more Angular versions

# üöÄ3.1.3
- `@/common`: Fixes an issue in `Base64` which caused incorrect padding to be applied 

# üöÄ3.1.0

- Minimum Node.js version is now 14
- Updated dependencies
- Cleans up a number of unused dependencies
- Now uses NPM workspaces for managing the Alterior codebase

# üöÄ3.0.6
- `@/common`: Fixes several bugs in the `Base64` class

# üöÄ 3.0.5

- `@/web-server`: Fixes a crash in `WebEvent.request` et al when called outside of an `@alterior/web-server` request context
- `@/platform-nodejs`: Support loading `.env` files from parent directories of the current working directory

# üöÄ 3.0.0

Final release of Alterior v3

# üöÄ 3.0.0-rc.9

- `@/web-server`: The message attached to `HttpError` will now hint that you shouldn't be catching this error, since 
  it's used for aborting the active request and sending an HTTP status codse
- `@/web-server`: When `WebServer.for()` fails to resolve the current `WebServer` instance, an error is now thrown 
  instead of returning `undefined`. This helps to identify "split brain" packaging issues, most commonly when using 
  `npm link` or other developer tooling.
- `@/platform-angular`: List peer dependency support for Angular 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14

# üöÄ 3.0.0-rc.8
- Bugfix: Wait until web service engine start is complete before proceeding

# üöÄ 3.0.0-rc.7
- `@/web-server`: `WebServer#httpServer` is now public (read only)
- `@/web-server`: Service classes can now receive an `altOnListen(server : WebServer)` event, useful for configuring
  aspects of the underlying Node.js http.Server instance directly.

# üöÄ 3.0.0-rc.6

- Alterior is now built using Typescript 4.5.4, previous versions used Typescript 4.1.5.
- `@alterior/platform-nodejs` now provides a global implementation of `WebSocket` implementation using `ws` if one is
  not already available
- Fixes `deepClone()` to handle cyclical object graphs correctly
- The `@SessionValue()` parameter decorator has been removed in preparation for the 3.0.0 release. This decorator was 
  deprecated in `v3.0.0-beta.76` released on 2/27/2021. Use the `Session` class instead.
- Added `@QueryParams()` parameter decorator as a way to get a `Record<string,string>` containing all query parameters
  passed via URL. You can use a specific interface type for such parameters, but please note that Alterior does not 
  perform automatic coercion of the fields of the `@QueryParmas()` object- all values will be strings.
- The `accessControl()` built-in middleware has been removed in preparation for the 3.0.0 release. This feature was
  deprecated in `v3.0.0-beta.2` released on 9/6/2018. Please use a Connect-compatible middleware package or create
  your own instead. Feel free to start from Alterior's implementation, you can find it
  at https://github.com/alterior-mvc/alterior/blob/c4e6730c98d7f2a6d20764612af0b7b2cd51c1e6/packages/web-server/src/accesscontrol.ts.
- The `@Request()` parameter decorator has been removed in preparation for the 3.0.0 release. This decorator was deprecated in `v3.0.0-beta.76` released on 2/27/2021. Use `WebEvent.request` instead to access parameters of the underlying HTTP request.
- The `RolesService#getRoleForModule()` method has been renamed to `RolesService#getForModule()`
- `RolesService#getById()` has been added.
- The `RolesService#start()` and `RolesService#stop()` methods have been removed. Use `RolesService#getById()` or 
  `RolesService#getForModule()` and call `start`/`stop` on the resulting `Role` object instead.
  
# üöÄ 3.0.0-rc.5

- Documentation improvements
- Factors out Express and Fastify specific code to `@alterior/express` and `@alterior/fastify`. As part of this, 
  you must now import `@alterior/express` or `@alterior/fastify` and specify it as the web server engine from this 
  version on. For example:
  ```typescript
  // main.ts
  import { WebServerEngine } from '@alterior/web-server';
  import { ExpressEngine } from '@alterior/express';

  WebServerEngine.default = ExpressEngine;
  ```
  Alternatively you can specify an engine via dependency injection:
  ```typescript
  @WebService({
      providers: [
          { provide: WebServerEngine, useClass: ExpressEngine }
      ]
  })
  export class MyService {
      // ...
  }
  ```
  This change reduces the complexity of Alterior's dependency tree by ensuring that excess web server dependencies 
  will not be present (ie fastify on an express app or express on a fastify app). It also fixes an issue where Alterior
  users were required to install a lot of Express-related `@types/*` packages to avoid Typescript errors during 
  development.

`@/annotations`
- The `@NgMetadataName()` and related Angular compatibility features have been entirely removed. They do not work with 
  newer versions of Angular. The recommended way to use Alterior with Angular is via `@alterior/platform-angular`

`@/runtime`
- The `--self-test` option no longer starts the application (so the `OnStart` lifecycle method does not execute)

`@/web-server`
- Adds support for `boolean` values on input parameters (ie `@QueryParam()`) when a parameter annotated with `boolean` 
  type is used. The values `''`, `'no'`, `'0'`, `'false'`, and `'off'` produce `false`, all other values produce `true`.
- Adds support for `Date` values on input parameters (ie `@QueryParam` et al) when a parameter annotated with `Date` 
  type is used. Any string value that produces a valid `Date` object via `new Date(str)` will be accepted, otherwise a 
  `400 Bad Request` will be returned without executing the route method. Caution: Because this accepts values in milliseconds (not seconds), it is not suitable for receiving UNIX timestamps.
- Adds support for receiving the ID for the request from a request header (ie `X-Trace` or so). Not enabled by 
  default. Use `requestIdHeader` option when configuring the web server to enable this functionality.
- Fixes an issue where request ID was wastefully generated twice
- Removed the `engine` option from `WebServerOptions`. Either set `WebServerEngine.default` or provide 
  `WebServerEngine` as a dependency to specify the web engine. See above for details.
- `@QueryParam()` no longer requires the `name` parameter. Similar to the offer input decorators, `@QueryParam()` 
  already supported auto-detecting `name`, this just adjusts the function signature to match the behavior.
- `CertificateGenerator` is now properly exported for external use
- Routes which do not return any result content now generate `204 No Content`, provided the headers have not already 
  been sent, and the status code selected by the end of the request is `200 OK`. If you need to return an empty body 
  with status `200 OK` instead of `204 No Content`, call `WebEvent.response.end()` before completing the request.

# üöÄ 3.0.0-rc.4

`@/common`
- Adds ability to get an entry from `Cache<T>` without doing a fetch operation
- Fixes an issue with `Cache<T>` where `null` and `undefined` are cached incorrectly. `null` now caches correctly and 
  `undefined` is never cached.

# 3.0.0-rc.2
> 3.0.0-rc.3 hotfixes CommonJS support via downgrade to node-fetch@2

`@/platform-nodejs`
- `fetch()` is now made available globally using `node-fetch`

# 3.0.0-rc.1

- First release candidate for v3.0.0
